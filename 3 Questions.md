1. What was your biggest challenge in this project? The biggest challenge is to create the new feature, that I have to fully understand my project and extend from current knowledge to think about a creative & meaningful feature.

2. What did you learn while working on this project? I learned the ways we could clean the dataset, create visualizations, and pull meaningful results from current resources.

3. If you had more time on the project what other question(s) would you like to answer? If I have more time on the project, I will be interested in the real mechanisms for the overlapped genes and compare & contrast each pair of genes.
