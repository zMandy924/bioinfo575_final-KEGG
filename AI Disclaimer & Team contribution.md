## Team member contributions and new features

- **Hongxuan Chen (uniqname: hxcchen)**  
  - Main contributions:
    - Completed Step 1: Map/merge the information by PATHWAY_ID and GENE_ID.
    - Completed Step 2: Compute the number of overlapping genes between every 2 pathways.
    - New Feature: Normalizes KEGG pathway overlap by pathway size and assessed pathway similarity. Because pathway overlap is strongly influenced by pathway size, raw overlap counts may be misleading and thus I looked at the proportion of overlap relative to pathway size.
